This project is a sample for working with the [Cognitive Services Speech APIs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/try/cognitive-services/) and shows how you can process speech input, translate text, and convert text to speech.

## Prerequisites

To run this sample you will need the following:

* A copy of the code (either by cloning the GitHub repo or downloading and extracting a ZIP of the code)

* [A Cognitive Services Speech API key]

### Getting a Cognitive Services Speech API Key

To get a Speech API key go to the  [Cognitive Services home page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/try/cognitive-services/) and click on "Speech APIs".
